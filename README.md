The application leverages speech recognition to identify spoken words and display corresponding sign language animations or images.

## Features

- **Sign Language GIFs**: Displays animated GIFs representing common phrases in sign language.
- **Alphabet Images**: Shows images of individual letters when spoken words are detected.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Utilizes Tkinter for displaying GIFs and images.
